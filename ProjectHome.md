Simple Steganalysis Suite (SSS) is a simple Java program to perform image steganalysis. I started this project when one of my teachers proposed to its students this forensic challenge : http://www.honeynet.org/challenges/2012_13_message_picture

I was already interested in steganography at that time and I had written simple java programs to embed messages into least significant bits of images. But I knew nothing about steganalysis and started to work on it.

SSS current features :

  * LSB Enhancement
  * Chi-Square test
  * Neighbourhood histogram
  * Pixel Difference histogram
  * Difference Histogram Attack
  * Primary Sets
