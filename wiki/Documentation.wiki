== LSB Enhancement ==

The most famous visual attack, described in :

_Attacks on Steganographic Systems by Andreas Westfeld and Andreas Pfitzmann_

Just extract the LSB of each pixel (or LSB of red, green and blue value for RGB images).

 * If LSB = 1 then set pixel (or color value) to 255
 * If LSB = 0 then set pixel (or color value) to 0

== Neighbourhood Histogram ==

Let us consider a normal RGB image. Each pixel has 3 components : red, green and blue. There are (2^8*2^8*2^8) = 2^24 = 16.7M possible colors. A true image does not contain all possible colors, this would require at least 16.7M pixels.
